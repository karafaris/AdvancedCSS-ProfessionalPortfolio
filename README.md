# Advanced CSS: Portfolio


## Description 


My portfolio of work showcases my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. Thus far, my portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Why I built the portfolio is because typically students who have portfolios with deployed web applications are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. The problem I solved was using advanced CSS to add style to my current website
What I learned was how to apply flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 



## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Installation
Clone the code from the main Github remote repository to your local repository.

## Tests
